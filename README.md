<h1 align="center">Knight's Tour</h1>
A Knight's Tour is a sequence of moves by a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. <br><br>

You finish the game by completing the Knight's Tour, in other words, visit all the available squares. The code makes it so that the knight can only move in a certain pattern identical to a knight's move in a chess board. For the first move the user can select any square. When the player clicks on a square, the square is highlighted in the colour yellow and the number of moves made so far is shown on the top bar. The next move must be to a valid move to another square. When that move is made it is shown in yellow, the previous move is shown in blue. When the entire board is blue, the player is announced victorious.<br><br><br>
